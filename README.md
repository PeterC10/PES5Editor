# PES5Editor

Option File Editor for PES5. Originally created by Compulsion, decompiled and updated by Lazanet.

This project aims to get feature parity with the [PES6 Editor](https://github.com/PeterC10/PESEditor), the main features are planned to be:

- All player attributes supported in CSV Import/Export
- Import players by ID to support partial imports
- Remove PSD integration

Note: Work is primarily carried out on the PES6 Editor which was based on a repo modified by Juce which included a CSV import for some attributes. This along with other changes in the source code between projects means it may take some time for certain features to be ported over.
